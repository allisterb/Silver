Ping Pong Sample Smart Contract
====================================================
	
Overview 
---------
The Ping Pong contract demonstrates how one contract can be used to create other contracts. It also demonstrates how two contracts can interact with each other.

Workflow Details
---------------
	
The ping pong game starts when the Starter contract is created. The Starter contract has a single method which can be used to create two Player contracts. When the Starter creates the Player contracts, each contract is assigned a 'Player'. Only the player is able to interact with the contract. A Player contract has an opponent Player. The opponent Player contract can engage in a back and forth game of sending pings, until one player ends the game.
